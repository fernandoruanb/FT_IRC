All code need to follow 42 school standards.

Only c++98 is allowed.

Always use the `std::` namespace.

Always try to make the code as simple as possible.
It means, avoid big functions, always use small functions that do only one thing.

Always use the `std::string` type for strings.

Always be careful with memory leaks and segmentation faults. Which means, always check something before using it.
